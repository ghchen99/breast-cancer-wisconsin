# # Cancer Diagnosis Prediction

# %% [markdown]
# This notebook focuses on predicting whether a breast cancer tumor is malignant or benign based on features computed from a digitised image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The dataset describes characteristics of cell nuclei present in the image, such as:
# 
# - **Radius**: Mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter.
# - **Texture**: Standard deviation of gray-scale values.
# - **Perimeter** and **Area**.
# - **Smoothness**: Local variation in radius lengths.
# - **Compactness**: Calculated as: (perimeterÂ² / area - 1.0).
# - **Concavity**: Severity of concave portions of the contour.
# - **Concave Points**: Number of concave portions of the contour.
# - **Symmetry** and **Fractal Dimension**: "Coastline approximation" - 1.
# 
# By analysing these features, the goal is to develop a machine learning pipeline to predict tumor diagnosis accurately.

# ### Correlation

# %% [markdown]
# We visualise the correlation matrix between features to:
# 
# 1. Identify Multicollinearity:
#    - Detect highly correlated features that might provide redundant information
#    - Help prevent model overfitting by identifying features that could potentially be removed
#    - Particularly important for this dataset as many features are derived from the same underlying measurements
# 
# 2. Understand Feature Relationships:
#    - Reveal patterns between different cell measurements (radius, texture, perimeter, etc.)
#    - Show relationships between mean, SE, and "worst" measurements of the same characteristic
#    - Help identify which features might be most informative for diagnosis
# 
# 3. Guide Feature Selection:
#    - Inform decisions about which features to keep or combine
#    - Help identify groups of related features that might be candidates for dimensionality reduction
#    - Support the creation of more interpretable and efficient models

# ### Box Plot Analysis and Distribution Interpretation
# 
# 1. Basic Distribution Statistics:
#    - Q1 (25th percentile): Lower edge of box
#    - Q3 (75th percentile): Upper edge of box
#    - IQR (Interquartile Range) = Q3 - Q1: Height of box
#    - Median: Line inside box
#    - Whiskers: Extend to last point within 1.5 * IQR of Q1 and Q3
#    
# 2. Outlier Detection:
#    - Lower bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
#    - Upper bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR
#    - Points beyond these bounds are considered outliers

# 1. Outlier Detection:
#    - Code calculates percentage of points that are outliers.
# 
# 2. Variation Measures:
#    - Standard Deviation (std): Measures spread of all data points
#    - IQR: Robust measure of spread, less sensitive to outliers
#    - High std + high IQR: Feature has wide spread
#    - Low std + low IQR: Feature might be redundant
# 
# 3. Feature Selection Criteria:
#    - High Outlier Percentage (>10%):
#      May indicate noisy or problematic features
#    - Low Variation (< 0.1 * median std):
#      May indicate feature doesn't provide much discriminative power
#    - SE vs Mean/Worst Comparison:
#      If SE variation < 30% of mean/worst, SE feature might be redundant
# 
# 4. Measurement Type Comparison:
#    - Compares variation across mean, SE, and worst for each measurement
#    - Helps identify which measurement type (mean/SE/worst) is most informative
#    - SE measurements often show less variation, making them candidates for removal
# 
# 5. Final Recommendations:
#    - Suggests dropping features with very low variation
#    - Identifies redundant SE measurements
#    - Creates list of features that might not contribute significantly to model

#   - c. Makes its own prediction (0 or 1)

# %% [markdown]
# **Why cross-validation?**
# 
# 
# For a 650 x 30 dataset, cross-validation is the best choice because:
# 
# 1. Sample Size Per Split:
#   - With a validation set approach (60/20/20):
#     - 390 training samples, 130 validation samples, 130 test samples
#     - Example validation scores might be:
#     
#         Model Config A: 0.85 (but could be anywhere from 0.80-0.90 due to random split)
#         
#         Model Config B: 0.87 (but could be anywhere from 0.82-0.92 due to random split)
# 
#   - With 5-fold CV:
#     - 520 samples for training/validation
#     - Each fold uses ~416 samples for training
#     - Example scores for same configs:
#         
#         Model Config A: 0.83, 0.86, 0.84, 0.87, 0.85 (avg: 0.85 Â± 0.015)
#         
#         Model Config B: 0.84, 0.85, 0.84, 0.85, 0.84 (avg: 0.844 Â± 0.005)
# 
#   **Now we can be more confident Config A is actually better.**
# 
# 2. Feature to Sample Ratio:
#   - You have 30 features
#   - Rule of thumb: want at least 10 samples per feature for stable estimates
#   - Validation split gives only: 390/30 = 13 samples per feature
#   - CV gives: 416/30 = ~14 samples per feature, but with 5 different evaluations

# **ROC Curve**: True Positive Rate (TPR) vs False Positive Rate (FPR) at different classification thresholds.
# 
# **AUC** measures the entire area underneath the ROC curve.
# 
# **ROC-AUC Score:** The probability that a randomly chosen positive case receives a higher score than a randomly chosen negative case.

# %% [markdown]
# **Example: Cancer Diagnosis Model**
# 
# Consider a model that predicts cancer diagnosis with the following ROC-AUC scores:
# 
# `ROC-AUC = 1.0 (Perfect)`
# 
# Interpretation: If you select any patient with cancer and any patient without cancer, 100% of the time the model will give the cancer patient a higher risk score.
# 
# Example:
# 
# Patient A (has cancer): predicted risk 0.9
# Patient B (has cancer): predicted risk 0.8
# Patient C (no cancer): predicted risk 0.2
# 
# Patient D (no cancer): predicted risk 0.1
# Every cancer patient gets a higher score than every non-cancer patient
# 
# 
# ---
# 
# 
# 
# `ROC-AUC = 0.9 (Excellent)`
# 
# Interpretation: If you select any patient with cancer and any patient without cancer, 90% of the time the model will give the cancer patient a higher risk score.
# 
# Example:
# 
# Patient A (has cancer): predicted risk 0.9
# Patient B (has cancer): predicted risk 0.7
# Patient C (no cancer): predicted risk 0.8
# Patient D (no cancer): predicted risk 0.1
# 
# Most cancer patients get higher scores, but there are some overlaps
# 
# 
# ---
# 
# 
# 
# `ROC-AUC = 0.75 (Good)`
# 
# Interpretation: If you select any patient with cancer and any patient without cancer, 75% of the time the model will give the cancer patient a higher risk score.
# 
# Example:
# 
# Patient A (has cancer): predicted risk 0.8
# Patient B (has cancer): predicted risk 0.6
# Patient C (no cancer): predicted risk 0.7
# Patient D (no cancer): predicted risk 0.3
# 
# There's more overlap between the scores of positive and negative cases
# 
# 
# ---
# 
# 
# 
# `ROC-AUC = 0.5 (Random)`
# 
# Interpretation: If you select any patient with cancer and any patient without cancer, 50% of the time the model will give the cancer patient a higher risk score (equivalent to random guessing).
# 
# Example:
# 
# Patient A (has cancer): predicted risk 0.6
# Patient B (has cancer): predicted risk 0.3
# Patient C (no cancer): predicted risk 0.7
# Patient D (no cancer): predicted risk 0.2

# ### 1. Learning Curves Analysis

# %% [markdown]
# Learning curves analyse how an algorithm's performance changes with different amounts of training data, plotting both training and cross-validation scores. Rather than evaluating your specific tuned model, it tests the basic Random Forest algorithm by training many fresh versions with increasing data sizes. In your case, the flat training score of 1.0 and high CV score (0.985-0.99) shows that Random Forests tend to perfectly memorise training data while still generalising very well to new data on this problem. This pattern helps diagnose if your modeling approach is fundamentally sound, if you need more data, and whether you're dealing with overfitting or underfitting - all independent of the specific hyperparameters you eventually choose.

# %% [markdown]
# `train_sizes = np.linspace(0.1, 1.0, 10)` creates 10 equally spaced fractions of your training data. If you have 520 training samples (after 20% test split from 650): 0.1 = 52 samples, 0.2 = 104 samples, 0.3 = 156 samples ...and so on
# 
# For each of these sample sizes:
# 
# 1. Randomly select that many samples from training data
# 2. Use 5-fold CV to:
#   - Train model on 80% of those samples
#   - Test on remaining 20%

# This suggests:
# 
# Your model might be more complex than necessary and could benefit from more regularisation via:
# 
# - Reducing max_depth
# - Increasing min_samples_leaf
# - Increasing min_samples_split
# 
# However, given that:
# 
# - CV score is extremely high (>0.98)
# - Gap is relatively small (â0.01)
# - You're working with medical data (cancer diagnosis)
# 
# This level of overfitting might be acceptable since:
# 
# - The model generalises very well despite memorising
# - In medical contexts, slightly overfitting to get better performance can be justified
# - The high CV score suggests the patterns learned are mostly valid, not just noise

# ### 2. Handling Class Imbalance

# %% [markdown]
# The code addresses class imbalance through class weights, which penalise misclassification of the minority class more heavily.
# 
# If you have 100 majority cases and 20 minority cases:
# - Majority class weight = 100/100 = 1.0
# - Minority class weight = 100/20 = 5.0
# 
# 
# These class weights are then used in the RandomForest

# %%

    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),

# TPR (True Positive Rate) jumps quickly, while FPR (False Positive Rate) stays at 0 for the first few thresholds. This means the model is very confident in its predictions as it can identify many true positives before making any false positive predictions.

# **Histograms:** Show that these are indeed important features as they show good separation between classes considering the feature by itself.
# 
# **Scatter Plots:** Normally, strong correlation between features isn't ideal because it means you're essentially using redundant information (multicollinearity).
# However, in this case it's less of a concern because:
# 
# The separation between classes happens along the correlation line itself - benign cases cluster in the lower left, malignant in upper right
# Even though perimeter_worst and area_worst are naturally correlated (bigger perimeter = bigger area), their combination with concave_points_worst helps reinforce the class separation
# Random Forests are also generally robust to correlated features, unlike something like linear regression where it would be more problematic
# 
# What matters most here is the clear separation between classes. The correlation actually helps in this case because it shows that malignant tumors consistently show higher values across multiple related measurements, making the pattern more reliable for diagnosis.

# **SHAP Summary Plot (first plot)**: Shows how each feature impacts model predictions. Each dot represents a sample, and the colour indicates feature value (red=high, blue=low). Position on x-axis shows impact on prediction (negative=pushes towards benign, positive=pushes towards malignant). Features are ordered by importance (top=most important).
# 
# **Dependence Plots (for top 3 features):** Shows how a single feature's value affects its SHAP value. The points are coloured by another feature that interacts strongly. Strongest interaction means: which other feature most affects the relationship between the main feature and its SHAP values
# 
# The key difference from regular feature importance is that SHAP shows:
# 
# - Direction of impact (positive/negative)
# - Individual sample effects
# - Feature interactions
# - Non-linear relationships
